# Start with a plan!

### It’s better to deliver some working functionality than to start many different little tasks and leave them all incomplete.

1. What are the specific requirements for this load balancer service?

2. How many endpoints will the LoadBalancer be responsible for balancing the traffic to?

3. Will the LoadBalancer return the optimal server/node as a string representing an IP address, or as an object containing additional information about the endpoint?

4. Are there any constraints or guidelines regarding the algorithm/strategy to be used for load balancing?

5. Is there a possibility of adding more algorithms/strategies in the future?

6. Is there a default algorithm/strategy that should be used in case no specific algorithm/strategy is specified?

7. Can the algorithm/strategy be selected on a per-request basis?

8. Is it possible to change the default algorithm/strategy for the LoadBalancer without making changes to the code on a per-request basis?



What is the main goal or objective of this project?

What are the specific requirements or features that must be included in the solution?

Who will be using this software and what will they be using it for?

Are there any constraints or limitations that need to be taken into consideration during development?

What is the expected outcome or result of using this software?

Will there be any future updates or changes to the software?

Are there any existing solutions that need to be integrated with the new software?

What is the expected timeline for completion and delivery of the software?

Are there any specific technical skills or technologies that must be used during development?

How will the software be tested and validated to ensure that it meets the requirements?




### When in doubt, don’t be afraid to ask whether your planned approach is correct before wasting time on implementing your own interpretation.
